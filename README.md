## Overview 
This Rust project shows how to use the TFHE library to conduct homomorphic operations on encrypted data in both parallel and single-threaded execution modes. The application maintains privacy by enabling safe computation on encrypted 64-bit unsigned integers (FheUint64) without decrypting them.
